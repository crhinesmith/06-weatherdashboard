# 06-weatherdashboard

The motivation behind this project was to create a weather dashboard so that one could see the weather in multiple cities projected out to 5 days. This project included everything we have learned up to this point in the course including Bootstrap, CSS styling, JS, APIs (both third-party and server side), and local storage. The weather dashboard is coming closer to how one would build out a usable application that a consumer would use in the real world.
